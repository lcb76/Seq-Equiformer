This project is an improvement on EquiformerV2 (https://github.com/atomicarchitects/equiformer_v2). Some of the Project's code is derived from EquiformerV2 and the Open Catalyst Project (https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem). The Seq-Equiformer model code is based on the EquiformerV2 model code.

Before using Seq-Equiformer, you need to configure the EquiformerV2 environment. Details please refer to https://github.com/atomicarchitects/equiformer_v2 or https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem. My method for configuring the environment is in the INSTALL.md file from the Open Catalyst Project (http://opencatalystproject.org).

Run train.py in the Seq-Equiformer folder to train and valid the model, and run test.py to test the model.
